# TrustworthyDistillation
To what extent can distillation be applied to the realm of TrustWorthy AI? This repository contains code for investigations into the robustness and explainability of distillation for the final project of CPSC 471.

# Running:
All runnable code are embedded in their corresponding notebooks. All definitions for models/helper functions are organized in `.py` files. All figures and models used in the report can be generated with the notebooks. All runs will be deterministic given the random seed in the definition `.py` files.
